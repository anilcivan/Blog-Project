This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project is an open-source application that utilizes the JSONPlaceholder API. Since the API doesn't provide image data, images are sourced from the picsum.photos service. The application includes links for editing, creating, and deleting operations. However, it's important to note that the API is fake, hence the operations do not actually take place. Additionally, the user interface has been made suitable for both mobile devices and desktop browsers, with efforts made towards responsive design.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
